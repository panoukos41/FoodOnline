# FoodOnline

This project was made for **Web Applications in Production** at [University of West Attica](https://www.uniwa.gr/) department of [Industrial Design and Production Engineering](http://www.idpe.uniwa.gr/)

The project is a web application for online purchasing of fast food from varius shops that are registered in the application.  

Some of the features are realtime updates to the order from the shop to the client, User registration to save stores as favorites etc, Search for stores based on the client's addres and many more.

The application uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as the database, [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) as the backend and [Blazor WebAssemlby](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) as the frontend.

# Build

You need the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) and a version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) that supports it.

You then open the FoodOnline.sln and you are ready to go.
